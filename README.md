# The Geometry of Survival: Radius-Specific Cox Models

This repository is for BDSI 2024's Cancer Data Science radius-specific Cox models group (members: Razmin Bari, Niharika Ghosh, Josephine Kaminaga).

Our project aims to answer how the spatial clustering of immune and tumor cells in ovarian cancer patients influences patient survival. All analyses, including the calculation of spatial statistics for the imaged patient biopsies, can be reproduced in the R markdown file within this repository. A version of our patient dataset which includes only the final covariates we used in our survival models can also be found in the data folder, as running the spatial statistics is rather time-consuming.

All of our data is originally from multiplex immunofluorescence images taken of 128 ovarian cancer patients, processed using Akoya Biosciences Vectra 3 and Vectra Polaris imaging platforms. More information on our data can be found [here.](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/vignettes/VectraPolarisData/inst/doc/VectraPolarisData.html)

We would like to acknowledge Grant Carr, Dr. Junsouk Carr, and Dr. Veera Balandandayuthapani (all from the University of Michigan Biostatistics department) for their support and guidance on this project. We would also like to thank the University of Michigan Big Data Summer Institute 2024.
